# Gun Deaths and Regulation
Work for the Statistics and Programming group project.

This work aims to verify the presence (or lack-there-of) of correlation between gun restrictions and gun deaths in the USA. 

To this aim, we're going to be using two datasets:
- [Gun Deaths (from the US Government)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedeltom/us-gun-deaths-by-county-19992019)
- [Firearms Provisions in US States (Compiled from many sources on Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/state-firearms.md)
