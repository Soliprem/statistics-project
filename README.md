# Gun Deaths and Regulation
Work for the Statistics and Programming group project

This work aims to erify the presence (or lack-there-of) of correlation between gun restrictions and gun deaths in the USA. 

To this aim, we're going to be using two datasets:
- [Gun Deaths (from the US Government)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/gun-deaths-in-the-us-1968-2021.md)
- [Firearms Provisions in US States (Compiled from many sources on Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/state-firearms.md)
